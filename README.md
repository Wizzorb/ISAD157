# ISAD157
This is the file containing my prototype for the ISAD157 Assignment. Simply download the file and run it in Visual Studio to see the code.

For this assignment I had to use MySQL Software to normalise tables of data and recreate them, then build a prototype for the data to show
how I would display the data. The data is sample information about Facebook users, their info, their friends and their messages. The
prototype I developed would be for an application that would display that data in a streamlined manner to a user. It is one page to keep it intuitive and I made sure it was easy to use and understand.
